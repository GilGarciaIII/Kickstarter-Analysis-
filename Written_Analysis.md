# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	Overview of the project was to understand the goals met and not met for Louis fundraiser's 
On a deeper view with money funded and which were successful and those that failed. 

### Purpose
	Doing a deeper dive into Louis Fundraising data to help her see the bigger picture of her fundraiser that have been successful and those that have failed and did not make the goal. By using certain excel formulas I was able to get Louise the analysis she was looking for as well as presented her specific data with pivot tables and line charts to make it easier to under stand with a visual.

## Analysis and Challenges
	The Challenges I had was separating the data that was actually needed apposed to the data that was not going to be used. After doing that using the correct formulas to make sure the data we were using is the correct data that Louis is looking to understand with their outcomes. A lot of challenges were just understanding the formulas and what excel can really do and help with these long data inputs we need to do to see the outcome and making it a bit faster like a shortcut instead of entering data manually cell by cell. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	Outcomes based on the launch date I used a pivot table and line chart table to make it a bit easier to understand for Louis by showing that the launch dates that were around the summer time from April to Aug were by far the most successful apposed to the launch dates in the winter or fall time. 
	

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Outcomes based on goals was a bit more difficult due to the amount of the money needed to be raised did vary in price. The outcome did show that she had a lot of more sucessful  fundraisers than failed it seemed to show that the higher the goal that was need to be reached was more successful than when the goal was lower. 
	

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Challenges I had was making sure the Charts I used matched the data that was showing. The line chart for me was the hardest to match the data due to the fact of me not being able to filter it like a pivot table. Would need to do a deeper dive into that when I get to the chance so I can be more efficient and quicker with the data I am trying to showecase. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Summer time launch dates are the most sucessful. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Seems like that higher the Goal the fundraiser has the more successful are on meeting that goal apposed to lower goals that need to be met. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The limitations I think were we didn't use the location of where these fundraisers were being held and what crowd of people were we trying to attract with getting to the goal. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Defiantly could have used a bar graph I think to make the visuals a little more basic and straight forward to getting to the point on what Louis was looking to understand.
